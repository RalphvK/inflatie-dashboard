This folder will store custom icons in addition to the standard Bootstrap icons.

To create a new build of Bootstrap icons, clone the Bootstrap icons repository and copy the files from this folder into its `icons` folder and follow the instructions in its `readme.md` to create a new build.

After the new files have been built, copy the `/fonts` folder and the `bootstrap-icons.css` file from the `font` folder into `/assets/bs-icons` in this repository.
